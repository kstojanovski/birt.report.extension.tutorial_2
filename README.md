# Rotated Text as custom BIRT item for Eclispe 4.9.0

This project is an example for creating custom report item.

It is based on the deprecated project which can be found under:
* https://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-BIRT-ExtensionTutorial1/index.html
* https://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-BIRT-ExtensionTutorial2/index.html

What is changed is the java version from 1.5 to 1.8 version.
Also the plug-in dependencies from the MANIFEST.MK are changed, the version number is increased.

This project was created on BIRT eclipse version (Report Designer Full Eclipse Install) which can be download from the URL:
* https://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/build.php?build=M-R1-4.9.0-RC1-201905231911

***

I have exported the plug-in as jar file and used it successfully in the eclipse.
