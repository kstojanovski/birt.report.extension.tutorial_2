This project is an example for creating custom report item in BIRT.

It is based on the links which are marked as deprecated and can be found under:

* Also the plug-in dependencies from the MANIFEST.MF are changed, the version number of the dependend plug-ins are increased.

This project was created on BIRT eclipse version (Report Designer Full Eclipse Install) which can be download from the URL:
